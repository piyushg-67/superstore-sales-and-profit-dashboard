# superstore-sales-and-profit-dashboard
For the task of sales and profit analysis I have downloaded a data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final 
I have created a dashboard using PowerBI tool.
The dashboard is all about the profit and sales per month and by category.
In This we see that The **Max. sale is in the month of November.**
But the **Max. profit is in the December Month.** 
We got **more Profit from the Technology one.** and **less from Furniture.**
The sale is **more from the Technology category** but **less from Office Supplies.**
I have created a table also in which you can see that sales from each state.
